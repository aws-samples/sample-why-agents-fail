## 🎯 Learning Path: Understand → Prevent → Scale

AI agents fail in three predictable ways. This repository demonstrates research-backed techniques to prevent each failure mode with working code examples.

| 🚨 Failure Mode | 💡 Solution Approach | 📊 Projects | ⏱️ Total Time |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **[🎭 Hallucinations](#-stop-ai-agent-hallucinations)** | Detection and mitigation through 4 techniques | 4 demos | 2 hours |
| **⏱️ Timeouts** | Context management and async patterns | Coming soon | - |
| **🧠 Memory Loss** | Persistent memory and context retrieval | Coming soon | - |

## 🎭 Stop AI Agent Hallucinations

**The Problem**: Agents fabricate statistics, choose wrong tools, ignore business rules, and claim success when operations fail.

**The Solution**: 4 research-backed techniques that detect, contain, and mitigate hallucinations before they cause damage.

### 📓 Hallucination Prevention Demos

| 📓 Demo | 🎯 Focus & Key Learning | ⏱️ Time | 📊 Level |
|---------|------------------------|----------|----------|
| **01 - [Graph-RAG vs Traditional RAG](stop-ai-agent-hallucinations/01-faq-graphrag-demo/)** | Structured data retrieval - Compare RAG vs Graph-RAG on 300 hotel FAQs, Neo4j knowledge graph with auto entity extraction, eliminate statistical hallucinations | 30 min | ![Intermediate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Intermediate-yellow) |
| **02 - [Semantic Tool Selection with FAISS](stop-ai-agent-hallucinations/02-semantic-tools-demo/)** | Intelligent tool filtering - Filter 31 tools to top 3 relevant, reduce errors by 75% and token costs by 89%, dynamic tool swapping | 45 min | ![Intermediate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Intermediate-yellow) |
| **03 - [Multi-Agent Validation Pattern](stop-ai-agent-hallucinations/03-multiagent-demo/)** | Cross-validation workflows - Executor → Validator → Critic pattern catches hallucinations, Strands Swarm orchestration | 30 min | ![Intermediate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Intermediate-yellow) |
| **04 - [Neurosymbolic Rule Enforcement](stop-ai-agent-hallucinations/04-neurosymbolic-demo/)** | Symbolic validation - Compare prompt engineering vs symbolic rules, 100% business rule compliance, LLM cannot bypass | 20 min |![Intermediate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Intermediate-yellow) |

### 📊 Key Results

| 🎯 Technique | 📈 Improvement | 🔍 Metric |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Graph-RAG** | 100% accuracy | Precise queries on 300 hotel FAQs via knowledge graph |
| **Semantic Tool Selection** | 86.4% detection | Tool selection hallucination detection (research validated) |
| **Semantic Tool Selection** | 89% token reduction | Token cost per query: 4,500 → 500 tokens |
| **Neurosymbolic Rules** | 100% compliance | Business rule enforcement - LLM cannot bypass |
| **Multi-Agent Validation** | Detects errors | Invalid operation detection before reaching users |

## 🎯 Prerequisites

**Before You Begin:**
- Python 3.9+ installed locally
- LLM access: OpenAI (default), AWS Bedrock, Anthropic, or Ollama
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable (for default setup)
- AWS CLI configured if using Bedrock (`aws configure`)
- Basic understanding of AI agents and tool calling

**Model Configuration:**
All demos use OpenAI with GPT-4o-mini by default. You can swap to any provider supported by Strands — see [Strands Model Providers](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/) for configuration.

**AWS Credentials Setup (if using Bedrock):**
Follow the [AWS credentials configuration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) to configure your environment.
