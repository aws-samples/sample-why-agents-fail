    "# Semantic Tool Discovery: Reducing Tool Selection Hallucinations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on: [Internal Representations as Indicators of Hallucinations in Agent Tool Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05214)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "When an AI agent has access to many tools with similar names and descriptions (e.g., `search_hotels`, `search_hotel_reviews`, `get_hotel_details`, `get_hotel_pricing`), it often picks the wrong one. The paper calls this **tool selection hallucination** — the agent confidently chooses a tool that doesn't match the user's intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gets worse as the number of tools grows. With 5 tools, the agent rarely makes mistakes. With 30+, confusion between similar tools becomes a real problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Technique: Semantic Pre-filtering with FAISS\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of giving the agent all 31 tools at once, we use a two-step approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 — Index tools by meaning**: We take each tool's name + docstring (e.g., `\"get_hotel_pricing: Get room pricing for a hotel.\"`) and convert it into a vector embedding using `SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')`. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for fast similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 — Pre-filter before the agent sees them**: When a user query arrives, we embed it with the same model, search the FAISS index for the top-3 closest tools, and create the agent with **only those 3 tools**. The agent never sees the other 28.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User query → Embed → FAISS search → Top-3 tools → Agent(tools=top3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **91% fewer choices**: 3 tools instead of 31 means less room for confusion\n",
    "- **No generic traps**: Ambiguous tools like `search()` or `get_info()` are filtered out unless truly relevant\n",
    "- **Semantic, not keyword**: \"How much does Hotel Marriott cost?\" matches `get_hotel_pricing` by meaning, not just by the word \"hotel\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Test\n",
    "\n",
    "We run 13 queries against both approaches and compare:\n",
    "- **Traditional**: Agent gets all 31 tools\n",
    "- **Semantic**: Agent gets only the top-3 tools per query\n",
    "\n",
    "Each query has a known correct tool (ground truth). We measure how often each approach picks the right one."

    "\n",
    "This test uses `registry.py` to dynamically select which tools the agent receives. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Tool Registry Works (`registry.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Building the vector index — `build_index(tools)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Called once at startup. For each tool, it concatenates `name: docstring` (e.g., `\"get_hotel_pricing: Get room pricing for a hotel.\"`) and encodes it into a 384-dimensional vector using `SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')`. All vectors are added to a FAISS `IndexFlatL2` index (L2 = Euclidean distance). The index lives in memory — if it doesn't exist yet, `search_tools()` will fail, so `build_index()` must run first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Querying — `search_tools(query, top_k=3)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user query arrives, it's embedded with the same model and searched against the FAISS index. FAISS returns the `top_k` nearest tool vectors by distance. The function returns the actual tool callables (not just names), ready to pass directly to `Agent(tools=...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Agent creation — per-query tool injection**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each query, a new `Agent` is created with **only the top-3 tools**. The other 28 tools are never passed to the agent — they're not removed, they simply never enter the agent's context. This is the key difference: the agent's tool selection space shrinks from 31 to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Why `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a lightweight sentence embedding model (22M params, 384 dims) optimized for semantic similarity. It runs fast on CPU, which matters here since we're encoding short strings (tool descriptions), not documents. Larger models would be overkill for matching a query like \"How much for a room?\" to `\"get_hotel_pricing: Get room pricing for a hotel.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "build_index(ALL_TOOLS)          # Once: encode 31 tool descriptions → FAISS\n",
    "selected = search_tools(query)  # Per query: embed query → top-3 tools\n",

    "\n",
    "Tests 1 and 2 create a **new agent per query**. That works for benchmarking, but in production you lose conversation history — the agent can't reference previous answers or maintain context across turns.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Re-register only the tools returned by `search_tools(query)`\n",
    "3. Call the same agent — `agent.messages` is untouched\n",
